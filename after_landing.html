    <p class="instructions">Welcome to the next phase of your journey! While the road may have felt long, 
        there's just a bit more to go. But fear not, the most challenging part is behind you. 
        Upon arrival, <strong>DO NOT</strong> go through the immigration terminals. 
        Instead head straight to the <em >Misrad Haklita</em> (immigration authority), where an agent will be expecting you. 
        They should be waiting at the end of the arrival hall with a sign. 
        In the unlikely event they're not present, simply approach any 
        immigration agent and inform them you're seeking the <em>Misrad Haklita</em> for your aliyah process. 
        They'll promptly assist you in locating the office. 
        Once there, you'll receive a crucial document: The <em>Teudah Oleh</em> (Immigrant Document).
        This document will facilitate various essential services,
         including obtaining your <em>Teudat Zehut</em> (ID Card), 
        as well as opening a bank account and accessing healthcare. 
        Please be prepared, as your wait time in the office may vary 
        depending on the number of immigrants arriving on your flight.
        It could anywhere from 30 minutes to 4 hours. I would advise packing food from your origin country
    however, the office should have some food and coffee</p>
