    <p class="instructions">Now that you've received your Teudat Oleh (Immigration Document), 
        you can begin arranging the essentials to thrive in Israel.
         I recommend starting by opening a bank account as your first step. 
         However, be forewarned: the banking experience in Israel can be challenging, 
         especially when compared to Western standards of customer service. 
         Each bank branch operates independently, so it's crucial to inquire locally about the best option in your area.
         While Bank Hapoalim is frequently criticized by olim, Discount is often praised.
          However, there are other options available, 
          so it's wise to conduct thorough research based on your location.
           Before visiting your chosen branch, check their hours of operation, 
           as they can vary depending on the day. Bring along your Teudat Oleh
            and all documents provided by the Misrad Haklita. Ideally, 
            your branch will have representatives fluent in a language you're comfortable with. 
            Inform them that you're a new immigrant in need of opening an account. 
            They will guide you through the process, 
            and many are enthusiastic to assist oleh chadashim like yourself.</p>
