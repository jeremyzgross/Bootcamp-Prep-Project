    <p class="about">I developed this project during my inaugural participation in the Hackathon Project for Developers Institute. 
        Prior to making aliyah, I was fortunate to have a supportive network of friends who generously shared invaluable tips with me. 
        Recognizing the challenges that some individuals face during their aliyah journey,
         I'm motivated to offer my firsthand experiences and insights through this step-by-step guide 
         that is straight to the point.</p>
